Project Completion: React Application Deployment with CI/CD and Cloud Integration ðŸš€

I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed a React Application Deployment project using several DevOps tools and cloud technologies. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what Iâ€™ve accomplished:

Key Features:
React Application Deployment:

Cloned and deployed a React application in a production-ready state on AWS EC2 instances.

Configured the application to run on HTTP (Port 80) for seamless accessibility.

Dockerization:

Created a Dockerfile to containerize the React application.

Set up a Docker Compose file for easier orchestration and deployment.

Built and pushed Docker images to Docker Hub with two repositories:

Dev (Public) for testing and development builds.

Prod (Private) for production-ready images.

Bash Scripting for Automation:

Developed two Bash scripts:

build.sh to automate Docker image building.

deploy.sh to streamline the deployment process.

Version Control with Git:

Pushed all code to GitHub and used the dev branch for development.

Followed a Git branching strategy ensuring proper versioning and collaboration.

Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline:

Installed and configured Jenkins to automate build, push, and deployment of Docker images.

Set up GitHub integration to trigger builds automatically when changes are pushed to dev or master branches.

Configured Jenkins to push Docker images to Docker Hub upon successful builds.

AWS EC2 & Security:

Launched EC2 micro instances on AWS for hosting the application.

Configured Security Groups (SG) to allow access to the application from any IP while restricting server login access to my specific IP address.

Monitoring Setup:

Implemented an open-source monitoring system to track the health of the application and send notifications if the application goes down.

Tools & Technologies Implemented:
React.js for the front-end application.

Docker for containerization.

Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration.

Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline automation.

AWS EC2 for cloud hosting.

GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Bash scripting for automation.

Docker Hub for storing and managing Docker images.

Security Groups in AWS for access control.

Open-source monitoring tools for application health checks.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps:

Continuing to enhance the deployment process and explore further optimization techniques.

Looking forward to using this as a foundation for further DevOps implementations and exploring Kubernetes for orchestration.
